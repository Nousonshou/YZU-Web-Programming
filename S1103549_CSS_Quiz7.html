<p> (Just long sentence.) Let me not to the marriage of true minds Admit impediments. <span>Love</span> is not love Which alters when it alteration finds, Or bends with the remover to remove: O, no! it is an ever-fix'ed mark, That looks on tempest and is never shaken; It is the star to every wand'ring bark, Whose worth's unknown, although his heighth be taken. <span>Love's</span> not Time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks Within his bending sickle's compass come; <span>Love</span> alters not with his brief hours and weeks, But bears it out even to the edge of doom: If this be error and upon me proved, I never writ, not no man ever loved. </p>
